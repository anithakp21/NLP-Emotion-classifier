The objective is to create a multi-class classifier prototype for GoEmotions dataset, which consists of 58k carefully selected Reddit comments that have been annotated by humans into 27 different emotion categories. 
The jupyter notebook involves experimention with different:
Data pre-processing techniques, 
NLP algorithms/architectures like SVM and LSTM, 
Feature extraction(Word2Vec and GloVe) 
Hyper-parameters tuning.
