# NLP-Emotion-classifier


The objective is to create a multi-class classifier prototype for GoEmotions dataset, which consists of 58k carefully selected Reddit comments that have been annotated by humans into 27 different emotion categories. 
In this study, I have chosen using a 14-label classification system for sentiment analysis, which allows for a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the emotions expressed in the text. The 14 labels selected for this project are:

1. Neutral
2. Surprise
3. Love
4. Fear    
5. Joy
6. Gratitude
7. Approval
8. Disapproval
9. Confusion
10. Sadness
11. Desire
12. Optimism
13. Realization
14. Pride                     

The jupyter notebook involves experimention with :
1. Data pre-processing techniques like tokenisation, lemmatization, stemming,removal of special characters, converting the labels to numerical format.
2. Experimentation with NLP algorithms/architectures like Supoort Vector Machine Learning alogorithm and Bi-Directional LSTM, 
3. Vector embeddings: Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings
4. Hyper-parameters tuning like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs.
